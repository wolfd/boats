# boats
Mathematica code for Olin's Quantitative Engineering Analysis boats project.

Also contains OpenSCAD files for cutting the boat design into many 2-in pieces to be 3-axis milled.

I wouldn't use this code to try to do anything at all if you're not me, it's very much tailored to my setup, and would require lots of change to work on someone else's computer.
